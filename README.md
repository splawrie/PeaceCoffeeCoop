# PEACE COFFEE
<a href="https://thawing-badlands-69910.herokuapp.com/">Peace Coffee </a> is a cooperative of small, locally owned coffee shops in the Raleigh-Durham area.  On their own, these coffee shops just don't have the resources to compete against the large corporate conglomerates such as Starbucks.  The quality of the coffee they purchase, the price they pay, and the different roasts and blends they serve are all based on what is available in the open market.  Each coffee shop that belongs to the partnership pays an annual members fee and there is a small charge per pound of coffee purchased.  These funds are then used to employ roastmasters and coffee importers.  This results in better quality coffee, fair trade prices, and the ability to develop special roasts and blends to sell under their own brand.
