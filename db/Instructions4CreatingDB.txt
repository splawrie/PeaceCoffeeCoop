The create table and insert data statements are included 
in the seeds scripts.

Run the PeaceCoffee database scripts in the following order:

1.  userseeds.sql
2.  productseeds.sql
3.  memberseeds.sql
4.  ordersummaryseeds.sql
5.  supplierseeds.sql

Load in this order because members table needs to user_id from the user table.

order_summary needs the member_id from the members table and the
product_id from the products table.

suppliers table needs the product_id from the product table,
the user_id from the users table.
